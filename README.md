### Javascript Snippet

If you use a different browser, you can still use Sintco Sparxmaths Solver by pasting the JS Snippet into your browser's console:

```javascript
s = document.createElement('script');
s.src = 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/SintcoLTD/CDN@main/chrome-extension/sparxmaths/console/inject.js';
document.head.appendChild(s);
```

This script fetches the latest JavaScript code from GitHub and dynamically injects it into the Sparxmaths website. By adding this additional code, it adds extra [features](#-features) to the website that allow it to function without the need to install the extension. You can also use the Bookmarklet.
